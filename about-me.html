                couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
        
            <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to
                live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship</p></div>
        
            <div class="about-me-para"><h3>>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my
                    possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it
                    worked. </p></div>
        
            <div class="about-me-para"><h3>>Now I live the simple life</h3>
        
                <p> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I
                    have more free time to enjoy. </p>
                <p> with how much it turned my life around, <strong> I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it
                    </strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p></div>
